Data cleaning, analysis using basic Excel functions, and an interactive dashboard.


Excel Data Cleaning, Analysis & Dashboard Project

This project focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful insights using Microsoft Excel. It includes a complete data-cleaning process—removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, handling missing values, and applying proper formatting to make the dataset analysis-ready. I have used essential Excel functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, IF, and basic text/date functions to perform calculations and summarize key metrics.

A major highlight of this project is the interactive dashboard, built using PivotTables, charts, slicers, and conditional formatting. The dashboard visually represents important KPIs and helps users quickly understand trends and patterns in the dataset.

This mini project helped me strengthen my Excel fundamentals, improve my data-handling techniques, and gain hands-on experience in creating analytical dashboards.
